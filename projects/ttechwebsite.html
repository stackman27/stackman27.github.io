                            <h4>Purpose</h4> 

                            <p>
                                Tustin High School Academy of Engineering and Engineering was in need of a new and elequont website to endorse its quality. The aim was not just to create a 
                                site and store all the valuable work going on on T-Tech but to emphasize the program and value that the program brings to the school and student. As a developer 
                                I had a serious job. I was just not devloping a website, infact I had to capture the legacy of Mr. Hernandez, the pride and acoomplishment and most importantly 
                                the impact that the program has had throughout the campus. Also, the pressure was above average as it was my first actual software project. I was taking in something 
                                that I was vaguely educated about but the idea was so intuitive that I couldnot resist.       
                            </p>

                            <p> 
                                The work had begun. I had sketched out the rough design of the website and I was ready to show it to Mr. Hernandez. Before that, I had created a similar  T-Tech 
                                website for my freshman year T-Tech project. It was a single page website with just pretty font and css. There was not interaction that delt with Javascript. 
                                Once the sketch was approved, I knew that I had to learn Javascript as quick as possible. There was no deadline but I wanted to wrap it by early september.
